                    No context app is a collection of no context texts or scripts, hence the name no context. 
                    These texts are mostly popular Filipino memes known by Gen Zs. Before, these memes are only posted in a form of pictures or videos. 
                    However, curated over time combined with the unhinged Gen Zs, these memes are now also posted in a form of text. 
                    These texts are also popularly used by K-pop fans when trending a hashtag or replying to their idols’ posts. 
                    Some more scenarios where these texts are used: trolling in the comments of a friend’s newly changed display picture, 
                    replying to unnecessary rude or disrespectful posts, and many more.

            <h2>Special thanks to</h2>
            <p>Carats (SEVENTEEN’s fandom) who has helped me gather these texts. We’re in this rose-quartz and serenity sh*t for life!</p>
